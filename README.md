### Bounded ACH Unification ###

We designed an algorithm that consisting of inference rules to solve unification problems in the equational theory: Associativity, Commutativity, and Homomorphism.


### Prerequisites ###
To run the algorithm you will need to have installed Maude, a high performance reflective language. 

### Install###
Download and install Maude from here [Download Maude](http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/w/index.php?title=The_Maude_System).

### Instructions to run the program ###
Download .maude files to a directory. Run the maude on your machine and navigate to directory where the files reside in. 
Load the file using the following command.
**Load** _file.maude_   
To check the problems in the file starting with p1, and so on, type **red in Unif : SolEqsACH (pn , b )**, where n is the problem number and b is the
bound under which we are looking for solutions.
